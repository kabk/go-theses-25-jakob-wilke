      This thesis studies the cultural meaning of hand&shy;writing from the
      beginning of its coexistence with the printed word until&nbsp;now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, handwriting has been understood as a signifier of authenticity,
      social class and gender, as a tool for maintaining social&nbsp;order and
      building character and as a way of disciplining mind and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      While working through the evolving conceptions of the medium in the face
      of changing technologies, value systems and concepts of the self, this
      text also explores the tension between handwriting as a representation of
      individuality and the imitation of standard models that it requires. In
      particular it focuses on how deviations from the standard model are
      interpreted as meaningful across various contexts.

    <p>
      Writing is not natural. It is a technology that facilitates “the reduction
      of dynamic sound to quiescent space, the separation of the word from the
      living present, where alone spoken words can exist.”<a
        href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>1</sup></a
      >
      It is an acquired skill “governed by consciously contrived, articulable
      rules.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>2</sup></a
      >
      It requires these rules for otherwise it could not fulfil its
      communicative function. Without them, the receiver could not decode by
      reading what the sender has encoded in writing. Thus, all writing requires
      a standard model. In print and typed writing this model is already set,
      waiting only to be arranged in a decodable order. But for one to acquire
      the skill of handwriting they first have to learn to replicate that
      standard model <span class="clickable" data-figure="1">(fig.&thinsp;1)</span>. Nevertheless, immediately after that process is completed
      or—arguably—as it is happening, the standard model becomes uniquely
      deformed by the individual that is executing it <span class="clickable" data-figure="2">(fig.&thinsp;2)</span> <span class="clickable" data-figure="3">(fig.&thinsp;3)</span>. Consequently, handwriting
      toes the line between individuality and conformity <span class="clickable" data-figure="4">(fig.&thinsp;4)</span>.<a

      This balancing act is oftentimes interpreted as the individual inscribing
      themselves in the writing. Even though writing is not an utterance that
      “well(s) up out of the unconscious,”<a
        href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>4</sup></a
      >
      it is still gestural. It can be interpreted as “a gesture which lies
      somewhere between drawing and conceptual thinking.”<a
        href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>5</sup></a
      >
      In handwriting the body acts as a bridge between thought and the written
      manifestation of that thought. Compared to print, it thus lessens the
      displacement of an expression from the living present because it still
      bears reference to the embodied conscience that produced it at a unique
      moment in time. This quality gives way to the commonly held, arguably
      intuitive assumption that handwriting reveals something other than what is
      written about the individual that produced it. The unique standard
      deviations in someone’s handwriting are read as additional information
      that is being transmitted, beyond what the letters themselves denote.
    </p>
    <p>
      To <em>reveal</em> of course implies a passive, involuntary gesture that
      is discovered. But as our own experiences with writing tell us, it is
      possible to deliberately affect this gesture. In fact, an essential
      quality that separates the handwritten word from the typed one is,
      figuratively speaking, an increased range of motion. Compared to the
      rigidly enforced, consistently straight left-to-right movement of typing,
      handwriting is a medium that provides an autonomous form of (self-)
      expression and self-presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the continued comparison with speech, printed and typed writing hints
      at, is that handwriting, like all things, gets its meaning(s) in and
      through its difference from other forms of communication. For example, a
      handwritten letter is received differently from an electronic text message
      and handwritten annotations communicate differently from printed margin
      notes. While the medium of handwriting is a message that takes on meaning
      through a system of differences, instances of handwriting become
      meaningful through how they differ from the standard model they are
      derived from, which in turn is again a defining characteristic of the
      medium itself. The exploration of these relationships is at the heart of
      this text. They mark the point of departure for an investigation into how
      handwriting’s meaning and role changes in relation to new technologies and
      how standard deviations in handwriting are read as meaning-producing forms
      across various contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first chapter of this text begins this exploration by providing two
      historical examples. Chapter 2 weaves together examples from popular
      culture with historical context and chapter 3 discusses handwriting’s
      meaning in the digital age.

      The invention of the printing press did not end the profession of the
      scribe.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>6</sup></a

      Facing a decreased demand for their services, those that were skilled in
      the art of writing began travelling around Europe, teaching penmanship to
      others. Next to classes and tutoring they began using the technology of
      the printing press for producing books to spread their lessons. As
      literacy was growing, so was the need for written communication and
      written records in administration and commerce.<a

      Thus, writing was no longer only practiced by a few but rather became an
      essential commercial skill for many. “Whoever would be a Man of Business,
      must be a Man of Correspondence,” proclaimed Thomas Watts in 1722.<a

      While merchants and clerks, those that depended on their ability to write
      well, were not poor, they also were not nobility. This coupled with the
      perception of handwriting as a mechanical skill meant that writing masters
      came to be thought of as craftspeople. An association that many of them
      were eager to avoid. Their publications therefore presented writing as
      something both useful and beautiful, as a necessary skill for the man of
      business and as one of the fine arts. Despite their efforts, the image of
      writing as manual labour was so dominant that there were instances of both
      French and English aristocrats purposefully cultivating messy, illegible
      writing styles to distinguish themselves from the humble who had to work
      with their hands.<a

      English nobility “despised the mechanical dexterity of writing a fine

      An example of this is a translation being identified as having been done
      by Elizabeth I. by means of the “idiosyncratic” nature of the handwriting.
      John-Mark Philo, the researcher who discovered this, states “For the
      queen, comprehension is somebody else’s problem.”<a

      Keith Thomas quotes Richard Steele as proclaiming that those who are
      unable to read and write were “scarce to be recognized among rational
      creatures”.<a

      Discussing the case of early modern England, Keith goes on to argue, that
      while it is questionable that literacy did much to undermine the existing
      social order, an “unequal spread of literacy…gave a new cultural dimension
      to social differences previously founded on wealth and power”—reinforcing
      an existing social hierarchy.<a

      Nevertheless, recognizing a connection between literacy and power meant
      that those intent on maintaining control had to find ways of regulating
      how literacy was transmitted, exercised and perceived—to keep it from

      Perhaps one the most alien methods of controlling literacy was how the
      perception of what was being written was regulated through the appearance
      of the writing. By the 16th and 17th century an
      extensive range of hands was being taught. Each of which was assigned to a
      form of correspondence or a social class. Precisely what connotation each
      script had is a complex history and varies from country to country.<a

      Still, to understand how this system worked, one can take a look at
      Billingsley’s manual, <em>The Pens Excellencie</em> from 1618, where he
      focuses on the six common hands written in England at the time. The
      secretary hand, for instance, was used for “all manner of business”.<a

        id="fnref19"

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is conceived to be the easiest hand that is written with Pen, and to
        be taught in the shortest time: Therefore it is usually taught to women,
        for as much as they (having not the patience to take any great pains,
        besides phantasticall [sic] and humor&shy;some [sic]) must be taught that
        which they may instantly learn? otherwise they are uncertain of their
        proceedings, because their minds are (upon light occasion) easily drawn

      What on the surface level appears to be an ancient brand of sexism reveals
      precisely how the meaning of handwriting was controlled and regulated. To
      maintain existing social hierarchies, the writing of women had to be
      somehow less than/not equal. This system allowed a literate person to
      judge the importance of a piece of writing simply based on its appearance,
      preventing any possible mis&shy;un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ings&nbsp;of status.<a

      Following the invention of the printing press, new uses of handwriting
      emerged and increasingly more people needed to acquire the skill of
      writing. While a system of standard handwriting models, where each one was
      meaningful, because it was assigned to a specific occupation or social
      class, might seem arcane from a present-day perspective, the idea of
      communicating something through the execution of the standard model
      persists—as the next chapter will show.

    <p>What does it mean to have beautiful handwriting?</p>
    <p>
      In Spencerian penmanship, the dominant writing system in 19th
      century America, writing was conceptualised as moral and spiritual reform.
      A process of character formation through conscious will.<a
        href="#fn22"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref22"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>22</sup></a
      >
      Consequently, writing instructors asserted that the appearance of a fine
      hand signalled to the world that its author was a man of character—a
      diligent and self-disciplined person—someone who could be trusted. Thus,
      illustrating the Victorian’s concept of character as an inner reality that
      is demonstrated to through outward appearances. An anxiety that resulted
      from this conception of handwriting as self-presentation was the
      possibility of outward appearance being used to deceive. What if the outer
      reality was not consistent with the inner?<a
        href="#fn23"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref23"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>23</sup></a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      At the turn of the century, Spencerian, and especially Copperplate
      script—of which Spencerian was derived—had been largely replaced by
      simpler, more efficient styles of writing. However, due their continued
      use in visual culture, they did not disappear, as the following examples
      will show.

      <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> opens with the eerie sound of echoing piano keys.
      The Paramount logo fades, and Manhattan’s cityscape appears, ornate script
      in bright pink placed on top <span class="clickable" data-figure="5">(fig.&thinsp;5)</span>. Mia Farrow’s singing voice nestles itself
      against ambiguous instrumentation, as the reassuringly familiar,
      candy-coloured writing continues to spell out the opening credits. There
      is a hypnotic dissonance between the text layer and the audio and image
      layers that is felt immediately. One can sense that what the appearance of
      the letters promises is only a surface, entirely unrepresentative of what
      lingers underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> was released in 1968 and is considered a landmark
      in the horror genre. In what Carstensen describes as “reflecting the
      collapse of commonly accepted metanarratives such as religion and the
      American nuclear family”, it explores the evil lurking beneath the surface
      of everyday life.<a
        href="#fn24"

      >
      The use of script in the title sequence functions as that surface. It is
      used to help construct an outer reality before the viewer that appears
      romantic. David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) employs a similar
      mechanism where elegant script acts as representation of the idyllic
      exterior of suburbia <span class="clickable" data-figure="6">(fig.&thinsp;6)</span>. Further examples of this typographic dissonance can
      be found in <em>Lady in the Lake</em> (1947),
      <em>Picnic at Hanging Rock</em> (1975) <span class="clickable" data-figure="7">(fig.&thinsp;7)</span>, and more recently
      <em>Queen of Earth</em>, (2015) <span class="clickable" data-figure="8">(fig.&thinsp;8)</span>.<a

      Among other things, these title cards exist in reference to other cultural
      products like movies of Hollywood’s golden era such as
      <em>My Fair Lady</em> (1964) <span class="clickable" data-figure="9">(fig.&thinsp;9)</span>, <em>An American in Paris</em> (1951) <span class="clickable" data-figure="10">(fig.&thinsp;10)</span>, or
      <em>An Affair to Remember</em> (1957). In these instances, the image of a
      handwriting style—that already in the 1950s had not been practiced for
      decades—evokes a sense of nostalgia, a longing for an idealized version of
      a different time and its traditions.

      The Victorians mythologised beautiful handwriting by interpreting it as a
      sign of moral virtue. In many movies of old Hollywood, the use of a
      largely extinct script creates a romantic impression of a bygone time,
      providing an escape from the present. Here, beautiful handwriting is used
      to mythologise the past. <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> and
      <em>Blue Velvet</em> on the other hand play with and subvert positive
      connotations, by using script to represent myths about domesticity and
      suburbia that are subsequently deconstructed. Arguably, all of the
      aforementioned applications of script in film make use of the deceptive
      potential of beautiful handwriting that the Victorian’s had already
      recognized.

      But what conceptions about handwriting and the self are
      necessary for the viewer to be able to interpret these letters as such?
    </p>
    <p class="sinnesabschnitt"></p>
    <p class="no-indent hyphenate">
      Although thought to be a signifier of authenticity and originality, a
      person’s handwriting has to be developed from a standard model to fulfil
      its communicative functions. Consequently, handwriting finds itself firmly
      lodged between individuality and conformity. It follows that the subject
      of individuality in handwriting has been a highly contested arena where
      the role of mind, body and soul have been negotiated.
    </p>
    <p class="hyphenate">
      In the centuries following the invention of the printing press,
      handwriting was generally understood as a representation of one’s
      occupation and status in society. Skilful imitation of the standard model
      it derived from was largely the only quality upon which it was evaluated.
      It was the romantics who first proposed a different conception of
      handwriting at the start of the 19th century, by beginning to
      interpret it as an unconscious gesture—one that escaped from within the
      writer revealing their innermost self. To them, a distinctive, even
      eccentric handwriting style signified an exceptional individual—someone
      who had liberated themselves from the conformity of the masses and had
      resisted the unifying cultural forces of the time. The belief that the
      genius of an exceptional person could not be grasped by means of rational
      analysis meant that this form of handwriting analysis was mostly devoid of
      scientific rigor.<a

      This is exemplified by Edgar Allan Poe’s handwriting analysis, where he
      used impressionistic language to capture the spirit residing in the
      autographs of fellow writers <span class="clickable" data-figure="12">(fig.&thinsp;12)</span>. 
      Mr Halleck’s hand, for instance, was
      “strikingly indicative of his genius. We see in it some force, more grace,
      and little of the picturesque.”<a

      This continued emphasis on exceptionality meant that this was a concept of
      <em>unique</em> individuality. It is here were the field of graphology,
      which emerged in the second half of the 19th century, differed
      most.

      Where the romantics attributed individuality only to a few, the
      graphologists focused on the common person. To them, all handwriting was
      unique and could therefore be dissected to reveal the personality of any
      individual.<a

      > graphologists aimed to create a picture of a person’s inner reality
      through meticulous, systematic analysis of even the most minute details.
      From the slope, size and spacing of the letters to the relative angle of
      the lines—every aspect revealed something <span class="clickable" data-figure="13">(fig.&thinsp;13)</span> <span class="clickable" data-figure="14">(fig.&thinsp;14)</span>.<a

      They argued, even if someone attempted to alter their handwriting, they
      could only change what they were aware of and would end up revealing
      themselves in the small details. Early graphology therefore provided
      reassurance to anxious Victorians by offering a method of exposing the
      true self of duplicitous strangers.<a

      Regardless of their motives, both the romantics and the graphologists
      worked with handwriting’s embodied nature. What penmanship pedagogy
      showed, was that because handwriting is embodied, it can be used to govern
      bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spencerian script, the initial conceptualisation of handwriting as a
      tool for shaping one’s character can be understood as a technology of the
      self, which, as Foucault described it, “permit individuals to effect by
      their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations
      on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as
      to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness,
      purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality.<a

      But ultimately, both Spencerian and the Palmer Method, which replaced it
      at the turn of the century as the dominant writing system in America, used
      handwriting as a technology of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      While both methods had interpreted schools as a site of reformation,
      assimilation and training in conformity, they aimed to achieve their ends
      with different means. 19th century penmanship instruction had emphasised
      the development of conscious will to overcome lower urges. The Palmer
      Method mostly disregarded conscious will and reinterpreted writing as a
      merely physiological process. Through endless repetition of so-called
      drills, writing would become automatic and efficient while also
      functioning as a disciplinary tool <span class="clickable" data-figure="15">(fig.&thinsp;15)</span> <span class="clickable" data-figure="16">(fig.&thinsp;16)</span>.<a

      in American education was not uncontested. In fact, by the dawn of the
      20th century, academics voiced their criticism over
      penmanship’s unscientific approach. While the two groups agreed that
      writing was an automatism developed through repetition—rather than an
      unconscious gesture revealing the inner self—they differed in their
      assessment of individuality. Academics expected variation among
      individuals, penmanship instruction reluctantly acknowledged it. But the
      academic concept of variation was not a graphological idea of granular
      differences, rather it was a system of comparison. Here, deviations from
      the standard could be used to place students on a bell curve. Uniqueness,
      necessary for dividing between good and bad, served as part of a
      hierarchical system <span class="clickable" data-figure="18">(fig.&thinsp;18)</span> <span class="clickable" data-figure="19">(fig.&thinsp;19)</span>.<a

      If anything, this overview of handwriting at the turn of the 20th century
      provides one thing: What graphologists, romantics, penmanship instructors
      and academics read in the standard deviation of handwriting varied
      greatly. But ultimately, they all judged it. They all derived information
      from it and used that information to make a value-based judgements about
      the subject that produced it.

      Arguably, the origin of these visual codes can be located in the modernist
      conception of the ornament. In 1892, Theodore L. De Vinne described
      masculine printing as “noticeable for its readability, for its strength
      and absence of useless ornament” and feminine printing as “noticeable for
      its delicacy, and for the weakness which always accompanies delicacy, as
      well as for its profusion of ornament.”<a
        href="#fn41"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref41"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>41</sup></a
      >
      De Vinne’s assertions precisely illustrate modernism’s perspective on the
      ornament and its relation to the feminine. One, where, as Negrin states,
      “the devaluation of ornament” means “at the same time, a dismissal of the
      feminine as inferior.”<a
        href="#fn42"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref42"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>42</sup></a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      How these notions transferred over to handwriting can be understood
      through how the perception of the aforementioned Spencerian script began
      to change towards the end of the 19th century. While Spencerian
      was specifically aimed at creating <em>men</em> of character, with time,
      it became commonly associated with stereotypically feminine qualities. In
      a posthumous text, its creator Platt R. Spencer is described as
      “femininely subtle” and his nature as “emotional and sympathetic.”
      Spencerian consisted of “graceful lines and curves” that were “pure and
      chaste and beautiful.”<a
        href="#fn43"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref43"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>43</sup></a
      >
      A stylistic variation of Spencerian, referred to as Ornamental script
      further contributed to this association by creating a link between the
      male “discipline” of handwriting and the female “pastime” of ornamental,
      decorative arts.<a

      <em>Lolita</em> is the story of Humbert Humbert, a French literature
      professor who becomes obsessed with twelve-year-old Dolores Haze, kidnaps
      and sexually abuses her. Described as “deeply disturbing and insanely
      clever”, as striking with “darkness and brutality”, Nabokov’s most famous

      captures the richness of its contents a near impossibility.<a

      It is the power of the image that pushes the importance of the use of
      handwriting on Lolita’s covers to the peripheral. But especially when the

      closer examination.

    <p>
      In Emmanuel Polanco’s design, submitted in the context of a book cover
      competition, the handwriting spelling out Lolita is a representation of
      Dolores Haze as she is <span class="clickable" data-figure="24">(fig.&thinsp;24)</span>. It is the crudeness of the writing, the
      disproportionate, scratchy and undeveloped execution of the letters that
      reminds one of the child that wrote them. This is done thoughtfully. The
      two L’s, the i and the a are written in print script, the script that
      children acquire first. Whereas the o and t are constructed according to
      the cursive style of writing which is taught soon after. The mix of
      scripts, the combination of upper- and lowercase letters and the
      disjointedness signal the writing of a child that has gone through the
      process of acquiring both methods in elementary school and has now
      discarded consistency in both—to continue writing as it pleased. In short,
      a child roughly the age of Dolores Haze.

      In one of the book’s chapters Lolita writes in lipstick on a mirror. This
      is referenced and simultaneously repurposed as a phallic symbol in a 1994
      poster of the Kungliga Teatern, Stockholm. Once again, the type of script
      and the execution of it act as a clear reference to the age of Dolores
      Haze <span class="clickable" data-figure="25">(fig.&thinsp;25)</span>.

    <p>
      Lolita’s pop cultural status means that its covers are not only read in
      relation to its content but also in relation to each other. Take the cover
      of the 1997 Vintage International edition <span class="clickable" data-figure="26">(fig.&thinsp;26)</span>. Here Lolita is written in
      elegant, refined script. This handwriting is standardized, it is
      stereotypically feminine and stereotypically associated with the romantic
      and the seductive. Like the depicted lips, it is suggestive. It is well
      developed and very intentional, knowing and conscious of being perceived.
      Its author is unclear. Is this a signature or a second image providing a
      clue to the book’s contents? Possibly, it is not even supposed to be
      perceived as having been written at all.

      Handwriting is commonly regarded as a “unique and authentic ‘signature’
      that claims to guarantee the presence of an individual writer during a
      historically unique moment of writing.”<a
        href="#fn49"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref49"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>49</sup></a
      >
      This claim to authenticity has been challenged fundamentally by 20<sup

      century technologies of mechanical and electronic reproduction.<a
        href="#fn50"
        class="footnote-ref"

        ><sup>50</sup></a
      >
      There is now the possibility of (re)producing handwriting in any number of
      ways, many of which can seem deceptively authentic. For the purposes of
      this text, this will be referred to as synthetic handwriting—disembodied
      writing, not in need of an individual writer producing it at a unique
      moment in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motivations behind the creation and use of synthetic handwriting vary. For
      instance, around 1800, Henri Maillardet built the “Draughtsman-Writer,” a
      self-operating machine that recreates not only the result but also the
      process of handwriting by mechanical means <span class="clickable" data-figure="27">(fig.&thinsp;27)</span>. It can produce three poems
      (French and English) and four drawings, making it the machine with the
      largest memory of its kind <span class="clickable" data-figure="28">(fig.&thinsp;28)</span>.<a
        href="#fn51"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref51"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>51</sup></a
      >
      Arguably, the driving force behind its creation was curiosity—how do you
      replicate the complex, organic gesture of writing mechanically? On the
      other hand, Adobe Acrobat allows one to sign multiple contracts with a
      single image of one’s signature, which is faster, more practical and
      overall, less tedious than having to go through the process of printing,
      signing and scanning.

      With technological advancements, increasingly complex and sophisticated
      instances of synthetic handwriting appear. Some of which only attempt to
      create a convincing image, whereas others try to recreate handwriting in
      its entirety. In
      <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</em> Walter
      Benjamin argues that even perfect reproductions lack one element—a
      “presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it
      happens to be”. What is lost in the process of reproduction is the “aura”
      of the artwork.<a
        href="#fn52"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref52"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>52</sup></a
      >
      To be convincing, synthetic handwriting has to somehow imitate
      handwriting’s <em>aura</em> of authenticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To define this aura of authenticity, José van Dijck and Sonja Neef propose
      three parameters by which handwriting differs from non-auratic typed
      writing. <em>Singularity</em>—According to Nelson Goodman, the
      authenticity of a piece of typed writing is not pulled into question when
      it is reproduced. On the other hand, even an exact copy of a painting is
      considered a forgery.<a
        href="#fn53"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref53"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>53</sup></a
      >
      Like paintings, handwriting’s essential characteristic is that it is
      unique. Even though it is based on a repeatable standard model, no two
      pieces of writing look alike. <em>Individuality</em>—We all write
      differently. Handwriting thus refers to an “un-exchangeable individual”
      assuring one that a unique writer was present during a unique moment of
      writing. <em>Materiality</em>—The movement, speed and pressure of the
      writing tool leave a unique mark on the surface they are inscribing.
      Handwriting’s materiality acts as further indexical proof of an origin at
      a specific moment in time.<a
        href="#fn54"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref54"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>54</sup></a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Handwriting’s meaning within various contexts is in many ways dependent on
      its <em>Aura</em> of authenticity. It can signify care when its perceived
      value lies in the effort and time taken to write something by hand. A
      handwritten letter is a labor of love that values its receiver. It can
      create a sense of proximity by facilitating an encounter between writer
      and reader. Author’s manuscripts, littered with annotations act as proof
      of an important, unique individual having held this artifact at a moment
      in time, making it feel authentic and scarce.<a
        href="#fn55"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref55"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>55</sup></a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When the seemingly unique gesture of handwriting is revealed as having
      been automated, its intended meaning becomes compromised. Thus, synthetic
      handwriting challenges not only handwriting’s claim to authenticity but
      also affects our beliefs about what handwritten artifacts signify.<a
        href="#fn56"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref56"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>56</sup></a
      >
      It contests handwriting’s value in the same way in which AI alters, for
      instance, the teacher’s relationship with the literary production of
      students.

      This can be understood by looking at autopen technology. First introduced
      in the 1930s, autopen technology allows individuals to sign documents
      without having to be physically present. Once provided with a sample
      signature, a mechanical arm—powered by an electric motor—moves a pen
      across the paper to reproduce the signature <span class="clickable" data-figure="29">(fig.&thinsp;29)</span>. It does so convincingly
      enough, that a layperson cannot discern whether a machine or a human
      produced the handwriting.<a
        href="#fn57"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref57"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>57</sup></a
      >
      Its use by politicians and celebrities—those that are required to produce
      their signature multiple times a day—is well documented. However, this
      practice is often kept secret, due to criticism regarding its perceived
      lack of authenticity.<a
        href="#fn58"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref58"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>58</sup></a
      >
      Besides having caused legal controversy, autopen signatures are generally
      valued less, both economically and sentimentally. Their application is
      often interpreted as breach of a social contract.<a
        href="#fn59"
        class="footnote-ref"

      For instance, in 2004 it was discovered that US defense secretary Donald
      Rumsfeld had used autopen technology to sign condolence letters to the
      families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. He faced visceral
      public backlash as a result.<a

      “The efficiency was antithetical to the meaning of the task at hand: The
      labor of hand signing the letters was precisely what gave them
      significance.”<a

      In this instance handwriting’s role as signifier of care was destabilized
      by an act of automation.

    <p>
      Autopen technology reproduces a singular, unchanging image. Albeit
      convincing, especially early iterations of the technology are limited to
      the act of reproduction, they cannot create. It is here where handwriting
      typefaces come into play. Technically speaking, handwriting typefaces are
      not an invention of the digital age. There have been hot metal script
      typefaces that allow one to print standard handwriting models. Typewriter
      manufacturers have offered cursive typewriters to give typed
      correspondence a more personal touch. But it was the new possibilities
      offered by digital typeface technology that completely changed what
      synthetic handwriting can achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early instances of digital handwriting fonts were comparatively primitive.
      Each letter of the alphabet was assigned one letterform, and those
      letterforms did not connect when being typed. The intermediate stage of
      fonts with identical shapes connected in identical ways evolved into fonts
      with multiple letterforms and multiple kinds of connections. By now, there
      are many typefaces with “contextually aware letterforms and ligatures”
      that connect sometimes and vary in how they connect.<a
        href="#fn62"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref62"

        ><sup>62</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the many examples of this is Schick Toikka’s custom typeface based
      on the handwriting of the artist Nora Turato. The typeface has varying
      forms, contextual alternates, and a feature that allows for words to be
      crossed out <span class="clickable" data-figure="30">(fig.&thinsp;30)</span>.<a
        href="#fn63"

        ><sup>63</sup></a

      It constitutes a re-standardization of the standard deviations found in an
      individual’s handwriting.

      In 2023, Underware introduced their typeface <em>Scribo</em> at ATypI 2023
      Paris with the talk <em>Scribo, ergo sum—</em> I write therefore I am.
      <em>Scribo</em>, according to Underware, is the most intelligent
      handwriting font they could imagine. “Full of human imperfections, but
      always exactly as desired,” Scribo has variations in letterforms and
      ligatures. It has parameters such as the length of the t-bar that depend
      on context, five options for five tools with which the style can be
      affected and more. Furthermore, “<em>Scribo</em>’s guiding principle has
      been to incorporate the action of writing into the design and embed it in
      the digital file.” Time-based elements such as speed, ductus, direction
      and order of strokes are added to the variable-font-file itself, making
      the act of writing animatable <span class="clickable" data-figure="31">(fig.&thinsp;31)</span>.<a

      Spike Jones’ <em>Her</em> (2013) is set in a not-so-distant future.
      Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a writer for a company called
      <em>beautifullyhandwrittenletters.com,</em> where he composes, intimate,
      poetic letters for other people. The beginning of the movie shows him
      dictating a heartfelt letter to a person named Chris for a person named
      Loretta. As he pronounces sentences such as “<em
        >I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you
        mean to me,”</em
      >
      we see the digital representation of a piece of paper on a computer
      screen, complete with the skeuomorphic detail of the right bottom corner
      curling upwards. On the paper we see his words, translated into
      handwriting, live, as he dictates them. The computer replicates not only
      all the idiosyncrasies and the materiality of handwriting, but also the
      act of writing. It animates the individual strokes as they are being
      written  <span class="clickable" data-figure="32">(fig.&thinsp;32)</span>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="assets/images/her-3.jpg" class="thumbnail">
      <figcaption>fig.&thinsp;32&ensp;<em>Her</em> film still, 2013</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Close inspection of one of the frames reveals that the computer also
      includes mistakes  <span class="clickable" data-figure="33">(fig.&thinsp;33)</span>.<a
        href="#fn65"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref65"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>65</sup></a
      >
      For instance, part of the word <em>everything</em>, is scribbled over. It
      is a sign of longing for genuine connection in an otherwise alienated
      world. Both Loretta and Chris need this message to feel authentic. While
      in the past, a mistake in a letter like this would have been a sign of
      careless haste, here it is deliberately added as proof of precisely the
      opposite—a genuine act of care. A thoughtful gesture performed by one
      human for another. The writing is disembodied but it centers around
      affect. By appearing authentic it fulfils its role as a sign of care and
      proximity.

      <figcaption>fig.&thinsp;33&ensp;<em>Her</em> film still detail, 2013</figcaption>

    <p>
      The added mistake illustrates that, once it becomes possible to question
      human authorship, it becomes increasingly important to include signs of
      the process itself in the result for it to appear authentic.

      That the cultural practice of handwriting will remain because its gesture
      is less rigid and individualized, because it facilitates a form of
      autonomous (self-) expression and self-presentation, is ultimately
      contingent on the assumption that these qualities will continue to be seen
      as valuable. Conversely, that handwriting is becoming increasingly
      obsolete due to technologies that are faster, more standardized,
      infinitely editable and infinitely redistributable is rooted in the
      assumption that handwriting’s only purpose is to quickly produce legible
      communication. It reveals a specific belief about what it means to write
      in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this text has explored, despite, or arguably because of, changing
      technologies, handwriting finds itself in a constant state of flux with
      its role and meaning being continuously renegotiated across contexts.
      Maybe it will just continue to be that way.
